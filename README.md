# Small Jukebox Homework Task for General Assembly React Course

This repository hosts the code for a small homework task completed in the old class-based React (rather than the more modern function-based React with hooks).

Here is an illustrative image of the project running on http://localhost:3000/

## Pros & Cons

### Cons
Were this code to be refactored, the following things could be improved:
- Obviously, I would use the most up-to-date React, rather than the older style using class-based components. One reason for this is that the new function-based React components require a lot less boilerplate, and have additional potential due to the availability of hooks (although, perhaps, one could argue that the life-cycle methods on class-based components had some benefits over their hook counterparts such as useState).

### Pros
What's good about this project
- I love the N64 8-bit style of the visuals. The buttons were slightly modified from a CodePen pen by Matthew Shields [HERE](https://codepen.io/MatthewShields/pen/pwrXpV?editors=0100).
- Working on the slider and giving it a custom appearance in line with the button styles helped me to advance my css skills when it comes to working with those html elements that are not always straightforward to style.
- While modern React with functional components and hooks is preferrable, it's always good to know how legacy code works.
